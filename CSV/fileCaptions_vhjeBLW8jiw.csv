10.96,5.6,a few of us here can remember when jfk
13.36,5.999,and mlk was assassinated and you'll
16.56,4.719,never forget how you felt for days and
19.359,4,weeks afterwards
21.279,3.84,some of us can remember where we were
23.359,2.561,when the space shuttle challenger blew
25.119,4.24,up
25.92,5.519,and many of us can remember how we felt
29.359,4.161,when princess diana was killed in a
31.439,4.561,tragic car crash
33.52,4.879,collectively these losses from school
36,4.16,shootings to racial injustice they
38.399,5.921,affect us all
40.16,7.04,in a collective communal way none of us
44.32,4.719,can escape the feelings of grief
47.2,3.999,and loss
49.039,4.801,some of you here can remember what it's
51.199,4.801,like when you have a child that's gone
53.84,4.96,from the home from the first time
56,4.8,i remember it like it was yesterday
58.8,5.12,and it was over 10 years ago
60.8,5.6,that my oldest son left for college
63.92,3.44,there had been a lot of excitement
66.4,3.2,about
67.36,5.04,acceptance letters high school
69.6,4.8,graduations and then we were helping him
72.4,3.6,get organized at the end of the summer
74.4,3.68,for this new chapter
76,4.799,in his life
78.08,7.039,we still had two kids at home
80.799,4.32,and his room still looked the same
85.439,6.481,i thought i was prepared for it
88.4,5.6,but i felt such a deep sense of loss
91.92,3.6,loss of his presence
94,3.28,and his spirit
95.52,4.239,in the house
97.28,4.96,i knew that i could call him at any time
99.759,5.441,and i also knew that he would be home at
102.24,4.48,different times throughout the year
105.2,4.32,but honestly
106.72,2.8,i was a mess
109.6,4.559,it wouldn't be the last time that i felt
111.759,4.081,this type of grief and loss on some
114.159,3.841,level
115.84,4.16,like many people i've struggled with
118,5.759,depression
120,4.84,with burnout and with existential crisis
123.759,3.921,november
124.84,5.479,2017 it was the culmination of a
127.68,4.639,two-year downward spiral
130.319,3.681,of a failed business
132.319,5.201,broken business relationships and
134,6.319,friendships financial failure
137.52,4.799,and mental exhaustion
140.319,5.361,what i didn't know not then but i know
142.319,4.56,now is these losses have a name
145.68,3.36,it's called
146.879,4.481,ambiguous loss
149.04,5.04,it's a phrase that was coined
151.36,4.239,by psychologist pauline boss in the
154.08,3.439,1970s
155.599,5.36,and she said
157.519,5.041,that ambiguous loss is a feeling
160.959,3.28,of anxiety
162.56,4.56,and stress
164.239,5.601,when you have a physical absence with a
167.12,4.72,psychological presence like when my son
169.84,3.92,went away to college
171.84,4.08,or maybe you have a
173.76,4.88,psychological absence with a physical
175.92,4.319,presence like living with someone who
178.64,4,has an addiction
180.239,5.601,or alzheimer's
182.64,6.959,we all felt this after 9 11 or maybe
185.84,5.84,observing the tsunamis in thailand
189.599,3.92,we looked around we tried to make sense
191.68,4.639,of it
193.519,6.401,and it was complicated
196.319,5.441,and then came the pandemic
199.92,4.319,we've all dealt with the last two years
201.76,4.72,in various ways individually but there's
204.239,4.961,a lot of collective things that we also
206.48,5.2,have in common
209.2,3.599,it used to be when i was driving home
211.68,3.839,from work
212.799,6.641,pre-pandemic i would pull my car into
215.519,6.08,the garage close it behind me and to me
219.44,3.359,that represented
221.599,2.801,peace
222.799,4.401,calm
224.4,5.04,solitude it was a time and a place
227.2,4.08,where i would spend time with my family
229.44,4.4,and my loved ones it was almost like
231.28,5.28,there was this
233.84,4.08,bubble of privacy that was rarely ever
236.56,5.28,breached
237.92,3.92,unless i allowed it
242.08,3.92,but those lines became blurry pretty
244.159,4.64,quickly
246,4.879,and it was breached in the form of
248.799,4.561,portals that opened up
250.879,4.241,through zoom calls into our lives into
253.36,5.92,our kitchens and maybe even into our
255.12,6.639,bedrooms if we had to work from there
259.28,6.08,and maybe your living room
261.759,6.401,became a classroom for weeks and months
265.36,6.24,on end
268.16,5.92,we tried to process this
271.6,3.92,and all we could say was
274.08,3.679,we felt
275.52,4.32,the blas
277.759,3.761,now don't be cons
279.84,4.24,concerned or
281.52,4.239,maybe a better word is confused
284.08,3.679,when you hear
285.759,4.641,ambiguous loss
287.759,5.201,there are very real losses
290.4,5.84,as of right now over 6 million people
292.96,5.679,have died through this pandemic
296.24,5.519,but there's something else that seems to
298.639,5.921,be brewing that we can't quite
301.759,2.801,pinpoint
304.96,8,that's ambiguous loss maybe you felt
308.08,6.88,ambiguous loss and less severe ways
312.96,4.4,you call an 800 number
314.96,4.239,you press one for english two for
317.36,3.76,support
319.199,4.72,only to wait on hold for another five to
321.12,4,seven minutes to have someone tell you
323.919,3.12,that you've actually called the wrong
325.12,3.519,number
327.039,4.561,if you're like me
328.639,4.481,i angrily hang up but then
331.6,3.84,i wonder
333.12,4.72,what is this other feeling this sense of
335.44,6.56,loss and maybe a little bit of grief
337.84,4.16,over a routine 800 number call
342.72,4.319,you felt voiceless you felt unsupported
345.36,4,you you couldn't connect with who you
347.039,4.321,wanted to connect with
349.36,4,that's ambiguous loss
351.36,6.24,now i'm a student of organizational
353.36,6.64,psychology and consumer behavior
357.6,4.8,and marketing and so i'm always
360,4.24,interested in how people react and
362.4,4.799,process information
364.24,6.959,and situations
367.199,4,the pandemic has been extraordinary
372.319,6,in the medical journal lancet in
374.4,6.56,february of 2021 it said this
378.319,5.6,in regard to the reviews of several
380.96,5.44,studies of pandemic mental health it
383.919,4,said that researchers had found that
386.4,5.6,many people
387.919,5.12,all around the world suffered from ptsd
392,2.479,anger
393.039,3.361,confusion
394.479,4,and it went on to say that the
396.4,4.079,researchers found that there's a good
398.479,5.361,possibility that many of these cases
400.479,4.881,would be long lasting
403.84,5.12,now
405.36,6.08,just as we we can process these losses
408.96,3.6,together collectively we can also
411.44,3.599,process
412.56,3.84,collective triumphs
415.039,4.401,think about it
416.4,5.12,the berlin wall coming down
419.44,4.879,people seemingly going up in space and
421.52,5.679,rockets almost all the time now
424.319,4.88,olympic gold medals
427.199,4.801,we watched tv
429.199,4.481,and we processed globally
432,4.68,these triumphs
433.68,3,together
436.88,6.4,i made it through my previous breakdown
440,5.84,and struggle with the help and hope
443.28,6.24,of something that i now know
445.84,5.919,to be called tragic optimism
449.52,4.48,it was a phrase coined by victor frankl
451.759,4.641,the famous psychiatrist and holocaust
454,6.56,survivor
456.4,4.16,in his book man's search for meaning
461.28,8,frankel said that tragic optimism
465.12,6.56,is the inevitable search for hope amidst
469.28,5.12,the inevitable tragedies of human
471.68,2.72,existence
474.479,3.921,frankel said that when we have a why to
477.28,5.599,live for
478.4,4.479,we can bear almost any how
483.599,4.481,and this next quote from frankel
486.08,4.88,jumped out at me and i believe it still
488.08,4.559,rings true for all of us
490.96,3.84,today
492.639,4.321,he says when we find
494.8,4.88,that we are when we are no longer able
496.96,7.6,to change our situations
499.68,8.32,we are challenged to change ourselves
504.56,5.039,you see tragedy provides an opportunity
508,4.88,to change
509.599,5.041,something within us to find hope to find
512.88,5.44,meaning
514.64,7.44,and we saw this during 9 11 as well
518.32,5.599,people spontaneously came together
522.08,3.68,to help
523.919,5.04,and to heal
525.76,3.199,and to process
529.12,7.12,this trauma that was so so tragic
533.36,4.64,yes ambiguous loss
536.24,5.2,does lead
538,6.56,to tragic optimism
541.44,6.16,and we can see this all around us
544.56,4.8,over the past two years and even now
547.6,3.28,we see
549.36,4.08,people
550.88,4.639,helping healthcare workers
553.44,4.56,goodwill toward them we see
555.519,3.921,volunteerism on the rise and and
558,2.56,donations
559.44,3.44,also
560.56,6.24,on the rise
562.88,8.959,and what we see is that ambiguous loss
566.8,6.64,organically leads to tragic optimism
571.839,4.481,now there are many of us that are still
573.44,6.56,going through ambiguous loss but there's
576.32,6.24,something else that seems to be brewing
580,3.92,underneath
582.56,4.16,for me
583.92,8.08,it feels like
586.72,7.44,a a brewing of hope and looking forward
592,4.48,to something that's coming that's much
594.16,2.32,better
598.399,3.601,ambiguous loss
600.08,4.4,is a trigger
602,3.6,for tragic optimism and it's a trigger
604.48,4.4,for us
605.6,6.72,to redis reevaluate
608.88,5.76,and it's a trigger to redesign
612.32,3.36,our lives
614.64,2.8,you see
615.68,3.52,victor frankel said
617.44,4.72,that
619.2,4.24,when you know when you have a meaning
622.16,4.08,and purpose
623.44,5.28,you can bear any how he also believed
626.24,4.96,that it was the tragedies in life
628.72,5.679,that pushed us forward and when we find
631.2,7.6,purpose and meaning
634.399,8.081,we find ultimately happiness
638.8,3.68,not the other way around
643.6,4.08,now let me say this
645.44,3.839,that
647.68,5.92,it's no shame
649.279,4.321,in feeling ambiguous loss
653.76,6.48,it's a normal human reaction and we all
657.44,5.92,must process it in our own ways and
660.24,3.12,however we can
664,3.36,but there's no shame in it
667.839,4.401,frankel said
669.519,5.921,that an abnormal reaction
672.24,7.2,to an abnormal situation
675.44,4,is normal behavior
682.8,6.4,from ambiguous loss to tragic optimism
686.56,4.88,now this all doesn't end
689.2,5.28,when the pandemic becomes endemic like
691.44,3.04,we're starting to feel
695.2,4.48,because there will be a next time i
697.68,4.48,guarantee it
699.68,5.04,maybe not the same way that we've gone
702.16,5.84,through this
704.72,6.559,but individually
708,6.72,you will face grief and loss again at
711.279,6.441,some point in your life and remember
714.72,3,this
717.76,5.92,tragic optimism will follow when you're
720.56,4.24,in the throes of that law loss
723.68,4.64,it will
724.8,7.36,it always does
728.32,7.199,it's what drives us
732.16,5.44,it's what keeps us going forward
735.519,3.281,it allows us to work
737.6,2.72,to parent
738.8,3.599,and to live
740.32,5.6,when our lives
742.399,7.44,even if they drastically changed
745.92,3.919,it's what drives us forward
750.639,4.801,to move forward to have a better
753.519,3.841,tomorrow
755.44,4.8,together
757.36,6.84,even if we're not always sure
760.24,3.96,where we're going
