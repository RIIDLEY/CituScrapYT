46.379,6.331,Barcelona kicks off against Liverpool
48.329,8.491,that known for you should be an amazing
52.71,5.31,game every year at i/o we learn and try
56.82,3.21,to make things a little bit better
58.02,4.769,that's why we have lots of Sun screen
60.03,4.949,hope the Sun comes out plenty of water
62.789,5.041,and shade but this year we want to make
64.979,6.361,it easier for you to get around so we

80.63,5.65,answers the number one question people
82.71,4.86,have where the sessions are actually

91.56,5.36,around we also have a couple of Easter
94.29,5.46,eggs and we hope you enjoy them as well
96.92,4.72,this is a pretty compelling use case and
99.75,4.229,we actually want to generalize this
101.64,3.979,approach so that he can explore and
103.979,5.07,navigate the whole world that way
105.619,6.04,there's a lot of hard work ahead and
109.049,4.971,it's a hard computer science problem but
111.659,5.07,it's the type of challenge we love
114.02,5.25,tackling these kinds of problems is what
116.729,5.82,has kept us going for the past 21 years
119.27,5.08,and it all begins with our mission to
122.549,4.021,organize the world's information and
124.35,5.73,make it universally accessible and
126.57,4.86,useful and today our mission feels as
130.08,4.31,relevant
131.43,6.21,Simar but the way we approach it is
134.39,6.909,constantly evolving we are moving from a
137.64,7.01,company that helps you finances to a
141.299,6.66,company that helps you get things done
144.65,6.22,this morning we'll introduce you to many
147.959,5.28,products built on a foundation of user
150.87,6.239,trust and privacy and I'll talk more
153.239,6.541,about that later we want our products to
157.109,6.151,work harder for you in the context of
159.78,6.81,your job your home and your life and
163.26,6.03,they all share a single goal to be
166.59,5.459,helpful so we can be there for you in
169.29,3.379,moments big and small over the course of
172.049,4.951,your day
172.669,7.3,for example helping you write your
177,6.03,emails faster with automatic solutions
179.969,6,from smart reply and giving you the
183.03,5.239,chance to take them back if you didn't
185.969,4.95,get it right the first time
188.269,5.86,helping you find the fastest route home
190.919,6.391,at the end of a long day and when you
194.129,5.461,get there removing distractions so that
197.31,5.25,you can spend time with the people most
199.59,5.639,important to you and when you capture
202.56,7.22,those perfect moments backing them up
205.229,7.65,automatically so you never lose them
209.78,6.28,simply put our goal is to build a more
212.879,5.881,helpful Google for everyone and when we
216.06,6.199,say helpful we mean giving you the tools
218.76,7.8,to increase your knowledge success
222.259,6.13,health and happiness we feel so
226.56,4.709,privileged to be developing products for
228.389,5.25,billions of users and with that scale
231.269,4.71,comes a deep sense of responsibility to
233.639,5.701,create things that improve people's
235.979,5.641,lives by focusing on these fundamental
239.34,6.84,attributes we can empower individuals
241.62,6.269,and benefit society as a whole of course
246.18,4.979,building a more helpful Google for us
247.889,6.09,always starts with search and the
251.159,5.311,billions of questions users trust Google
253.979,6.781,with every day but there is so much more
256.47,5.85,we can do to help our users last year we
260.76,3.84,launched a new feature in Google News
262.32,4.02,called full coverage
264.6,4.38,and we have gotten great feedback on it
266.34,5.49,from our users will be bringing full
268.98,5.55,coverage directly to search to better
271.83,6.48,organize results for news related topics
274.53,6.51,let's take an example if you search for
278.31,5.52,black hole will surface the relevant top
281.04,4.8,news it was in the news recently we use
283.83,4.86,machine learning to identify different
285.84,5.37,types of stories and give you a complete
288.69,5.76,picture of how a story is being reported
291.21,5.91,from a wide variety of sources you can
294.45,5.28,click into full coverage it surfaces a
297.12,4.8,breadth of content but allows you to
299.73,4.62,drill down into what interests you you
301.92,5.46,can check out different aspects of the
304.35,6.09,story like how the black hole got its
307.38,5.37,name you can even now see a timeline of
310.44,6.11,events and we'll be bringing this to
312.75,5.82,search later this year podcasts are
316.55,5.14,another important source of information
318.57,7.23,and we'll be bringing them directly to
321.69,6.87,search as well by indexing podcasts we
325.8,5.49,can surface relevant episodes based on
328.56,4.77,their content not just a title and you
331.29,5.28,can tap to listen right in search
333.33,6.15,results or you can save an episode for
336.57,6.03,listening later on your commute or your
339.48,4.95,Google home these are all examples of
342.6,4.62,how we are making search even more
344.43,5.04,helpful for our users surfacing the
347.22,5.37,right information in the right context
349.47,6.36,and sometimes what's most helpful and
352.59,7.62,understanding the world is being able to
355.83,7.29,see it visually to show you how we are
360.21,6.41,bringing you visual information directly
363.12,4.06,in search here sup or not
366.62,9.899,[Music]
367.18,9.339,[Applause]
376.66,4.54,whether you're learning about the solar
378.95,5.67,system or trying to choose a color
381.2,6.33,scheme for your home seeing is often
384.62,5.7,understanding with computer vision and
387.53,3.39,augmented reality the camera in our
390.32,3.06,hands
390.92,4.5,is turning into a powerful visual tool
393.38,6.03,to help you understand the world around
395.42,7.5,you so today we are excited to bring the
399.41,5.31,camera to Google search adding a new
402.92,4.35,dimension to your search results
404.72,5.67,actually three dimensions to be precise
407.27,6.51,so let's take a look say you're a
410.39,5.07,student studying human anatomy now when
413.78,5.28,you search for something like muscle
415.46,6.3,flexion you can view a 3d model built by
419.06,7.62,visible body right from the search
421.76,7.89,results not only that pretty go not only
426.68,11.37,that you can also place it in your own
429.65,11.73,space look it's one thing to read about
438.05,6.03,flexion or extensions but seeing it in
441.38,5.48,action right in front of you while
444.08,5.49,you're studying the concept very handy
446.86,4.9,okay let's take another example say
449.57,5.46,instead of studying your shopping for a
451.76,5.88,new pair of shoes that happens with New
455.03,5.4,Balance you can look at shoes up close
457.64,5.58,from different angles again directly
460.43,5.13,from search that way you get a much
463.22,5.01,better sense for things like what does
465.56,6.74,the grip look like on the sole or how
468.23,4.07,they match with the rest of your clothes
475.86,6.429,okay this last example is a really fun
479.38,4.439,one so you may have all seen a great
482.289,4.921,white shark in the movies
483.819,7.861,jaws anyone but what does it actually
487.21,6.51,look like up close let's find out shall
491.68,4.65,we okay
493.72,5.16,I have Archana here with me to help with
496.33,5.94,the demo so let's go ahead search for
498.88,5.099,great white shark on Google as you
502.27,5.1,scroll through you get information on
503.979,6.69,the knowledge panel facts but also see
507.37,6.81,the shark in 3d directly from the
510.669,7.321,knowledge panel why don't we go one step
514.18,12.93,further why don't we invite the shark to
517.99,12.09,the stage you know it's one thing to
527.11,5.57,read a fact like a great white can be
530.08,6.12,anywhere between 17 feet to 21 feet long
532.68,5.83,but to see it in front of you at scale
536.2,3,filling up the shoreline stage like a
538.51,3.74,rock star
539.2,5.61,that is truly understanding its scale
542.25,6.76,okay let's take a closer look it's an AR
544.81,6.839,shark it won't bite oh look at those
549.01,4.829,layers of teeth you know I don't know
551.649,4.38,about you all but I'd much rather see
553.839,7.431,these teeth up close and a R than in
556.029,5.241,real life thank you Archana
563.13,5.71,really excited about bringing the camera
566.08,5.55,and a our capabilities to Google search
568.84,4.92,now sometimes though the things that
571.63,5.01,you're interested in they're difficult
573.76,6.24,to describe in a search box so that's
576.64,6.3,why we created Google lense to help you
580,6.69,search and do more with what you see by
582.94,7.14,simply pointing your camera we've built
586.69,5.64,lens as a capability across products so
590.08,4.95,you can access it directly from the
592.33,5.4,Google assistant but we've also built it
595.03,6.99,into Google photos and the camera app on
597.73,7.71,many Android devices people have already
602.02,6.3,used lens more than a billion times so
605.44,5.76,far and abused it to ask questions about
608.32,5.58,what they see like what kind of flower
611.2,7.08,that is or where to get a lamp like that
613.9,6.33,or just who the artist is one way we've
618.28,4.26,been thinking about it is with lens
620.23,5.16,we're indexing the physical world
622.54,6,billions of places and products and so
625.39,6.54,on much like search indexes the billions
628.54,5.58,of pages on the web okay
631.93,5.24,today let me show you some new ways that
634.12,5.73,we're making lens more helpful to you
637.17,5.29,say you're at a restaurant trying to
639.85,4.95,figure out what to order instead of
642.46,4.44,going from the menu to different apps on
644.8,7.22,the phone and back to the menu and so on
646.9,7.8,you can simply point your camera lens
652.02,5.68,automatically highlights the popular
654.7,5.18,dishes at this restaurant right on the
657.7,2.18,menu
663.019,5.981,and of course if you want to know more
666.12,5.55,you can tap on any dish on the menu and
669,7.68,you can see what it looks like again at
671.67,6.96,the restaurant and of course check out
676.68,6.33,what other people are saying about it on
678.63,7.55,Google Maps by the way when you're done
683.01,6.24,eating lens can help pay for your meal
686.18,7.06,not so fast it's not picking up your tab
689.25,8.88,but it can calculate the tip and even
693.24,9.5,split the total again just by pointing
698.13,4.61,your camera at the receipt and voila
707.77,6.1,so you saw how we connected the menu
710.69,4.589,with information from Google Maps but
713.87,3.9,we're starting to think of other ways
715.279,4.891,that we can connect helpful digital
717.77,4.53,information with the things in the
720.17,3.48,physical world so I'm going to give you
722.3,3.75,just one example
723.65,4.61,so you're flipping through a Bon Appetit
726.05,5.4,magazine and you see a recipe you like
728.26,7.89,soon you can point your camera at the
731.45,8.13,recipe and see the page come alive
736.15,5.71,showing you how to make the dish we're
739.58,4.8,starting to work with more partners like
741.86,4.89,museums magazine publishers and
744.38,8.01,retailers to bring unique visual
746.75,8.279,experiences like this there's one final
752.39,5.82,area where we think that the camera can
755.029,5.281,be particularly helpful to people around
758.21,4.95,the world there are more than 800
760.31,4.86,million adults for struggling to read
763.16,5.49,the words that they come across in their
765.17,6.33,daily lives bus schedules Bank forms etc
768.65,6.27,and many of them are coming online for
771.5,5.97,the first time with a smartphone so to
774.92,6.51,help with that we've integrated a new
777.47,7.489,camera capability into Google go this is
781.43,7.82,our search app for entry-level devices
784.959,7.031,take this sign in English next to an ATM
789.25,5.43,now for someone who does not understand
791.99,5.49,the language and cannot read the words
794.68,5.77,this is important information that
797.48,4.89,they're not getting access to and we
800.45,5.579,think that the camera can help here so
802.37,7.589,let me show you how so directly from the
806.029,6.75,Google search bar you can use lens open
809.959,7.021,it point it at the sign to hear the text
812.779,6.541,read out aloud to you information for
816.98,4.38,card holders all customers using old
819.32,2.87,proprietary magnetic stripe cards should
821.36,3.51,be advised
822.19,4.72,what is nice here is that it is
824.87,4.68,highlighting the words as they're spoken
826.91,5.369,that way even if you can't read the
829.55,4.89,language well you can follow along and
832.279,5.761,you understand the full context of what
834.44,6.209,you see you can also translate it into
838.04,5.76,your own language
840.649,3.151,like this
847.999,4.62,notice that the translated text is
850.519,5.13,overlaid right on top of the original
852.619,5.55,sign you know it almost feels like the
855.649,5.64,sign was written in your own language to
858.169,5.7,start with and again you can hit listen
861.289,4.95,and hear the words read out loud this
863.869,10.351,time in your own language información
866.239,11.481,para los titulares de la tarjeta what
874.22,6.899,you're seeing here is text speech
877.72,5.649,computer vision the power of translate
881.119,5.49,and twenty years of language
883.369,7.98,understanding from search all coming
886.609,6.87,together now our teams in India have
891.349,4.17,been working with some early testers and
893.479,4.14,getting a lot of feedback to make the
895.519,4.65,product better and I want to now show

1012.279,6.31,it's the power to get things done so we
1016.67,4.89,want to make this feature accessible to

1021.56,6.45,works in more than a dozen languages and
1024.819,5.651,the teams worked incredibly hard to
1028.01,11.46,compress all of this tech to just over a
1030.47,14.64,hundred kilobytes that way it can work
1039.47,8.219,on phones that cost as little as $35 so
1045.11,4.59,we're super excited about this and all
1047.689,4.041,the other features across search and

1099.1,6.449,but from businesses as well for us
1102.99,6.52,duplexes to approach by which we train
1105.549,8.191,AI on simple but familiar tasks to
1109.51,5.49,accomplish them and save you time duplex
1113.74,4.11,was launched with restaurant
1115,6.48,reservations on the phone but now we are
1117.85,7.47,moving beyond voice and extending duplex
1121.48,6.809,to tasks on the web we again want to
1125.32,4.8,focus on narrow use cases to start so we
1128.289,5.431,are looking at rental car bookings as
1130.12,6.27,well as movie ticketing today when you
1133.72,5.03,make a new reservation online you have
1136.39,5.399,to navigate a number of pages and steps
1138.75,4.659,filling out information and making
1141.789,3.811,selections along the way I'm sure you're
1143.409,4.801,all familiar with this experience it's
1145.6,4.62,time consuming and if users leave during
1148.21,4.17,the work flow businesses lose out as
1150.22,5.91,well we want to make this experience
1152.38,5.909,better for both users and businesses so
1156.13,4.65,let me show you how the assistant can do
1158.289,5.52,it better say you get a calendar
1160.78,5.009,reminder about an upcoming trip and you
1163.809,4.921,want to book a rental car you can just
1165.789,4.201,ask google book a national car rental
1168.73,3.96,for my next trip
1169.99,6,the assistant opens the national website
1172.69,6.44,and automatically starts filling out
1175.99,7.049,your information on your behalf
1179.13,7.029,including the dates of the trip you can
1183.039,6.181,confirm the details with just a tab and
1186.159,6,then the assistant continues to navigate
1189.22,5.97,the site it even selects which car you
1192.159,5.25,like it's acting on your behalf and
1195.19,4.01,helping you save time but you're always
1197.409,5.001,in control of the flow
1199.2,6.19,let's go ahead and add a car seat and
1202.41,5.74,once all the details are in you can
1205.39,6.06,check everything one last time and just
1208.15,6.29,tap to finalize the reservation you'll
1211.45,5.55,immediately get a booking confirmation
1214.44,6.25,it's amazing to see the assistant
1217,7.2,complete a task online on your behalf in
1220.69,5.43,a personalized way it understands the
1224.2,4.59,dates of your trip and your car
1226.12,5.91,preferences based on trip confirmations
1228.79,5.88,in Gmail I also want to point out that
1232.03,5.28,this was not a custom integration this
1234.67,5.4,required no action on part of the
1237.31,4.92,business to implement what you just saw
1240.07,6.39,is an early preview of what we are
1242.23,6,calling duplex on the web we're going to
1246.46,3.51,be thoughtful and get feedback from both
1248.23,3.69,users and businesses to improve the
1249.97,6.8,experience and we'll have more details
1251.92,4.85,to share later this year
1261.27,4.99,the Google assistant helps people around
1264.49,3.83,the world with all kinds of tasks
1266.26,4.95,whether they are at home or on the go
1268.32,6.04,but we want to build an even more
1271.21,5.64,helpful assistant in order to process
1274.36,5.04,speech today we rely on complex
1276.85,6.36,algorithms it includes multiple machine
1279.4,7.5,learning models one model Maps incoming
1283.21,5.64,sound bites into phonetic units another
1286.9,5.37,one takes and assembles these phonetic
1288.85,5.73,units into words and then a third model
1292.27,5.19,predicts the likelihood of these words
1294.58,4.29,in a sequence they are so complex that
1297.46,4.31,they require hundred gigabytes of
1298.87,5.37,storage and a network connection
1301.77,4.78,bringing these models to your phone
1304.24,4.35,think of it as putting the power of a
1306.55,4.08,googol data center in your pocket
1308.59,5.4,it's an incredibly challenging computer
1310.63,6.299,science problem I'm excited to share we
1313.99,5.34,reached a significant milestone further
1316.929,5.791,advances in deep learning have allowed
1319.33,5.84,us to combine and shrink the hundred
1322.72,5.67,gigabyte models down to half a gigabyte
1325.17,7.72,small enough to bring it on to mobile
1328.39,7.61,devices this eliminates network latency
1332.89,6.69,and makes the assistant so much faster
1336,7.36,so fast that tapping to use your phone
1339.58,5.64,would seem slow I think this is going to
1343.36,5.22,transform the future of the assistant
1345.22,5.43,and I'm thrilled to bring Scott to tell
1348.58,4.57,you more about our next generation
1350.65,3.3,assistant
1353.15,1.35,[Applause]
1353.95,5.44,[Music]
1354.5,7.92,[Applause]
1359.39,5.43,thanks sundar well what if we could
1362.42,5.25,bring the AI that powers the assistant
1364.82,5.01,right onto your phone what if the
1367.67,4.59,assistant was so fast at processing your
1369.83,5.82,voice that tapping to operate your phone
1372.26,5.16,would almost seem slow it opens up many
1375.65,5.13,new use cases and we want to show you
1377.42,5.31,how fast it is now internally we've been
1380.78,4.74,calling this the next-generation
1382.73,5.52,assistant running on device it can
1385.52,5.49,process and understand requests in real
1388.25,6.66,time and deliver the answers up to 10
1391.01,5.97,times faster now Maggie's here and she's
1394.91,3.96,gonna help us test it out starting with
1396.98,4.74,some back-to-back commands to
1398.87,5.13,demonstrate its speed now this demo is
1401.72,4.17,hot off the press so please send your
1404,12.39,positive energy over a neg ease
1405.89,16.529,direction hey Google open calendar open
1416.39,11.85,calculator open photos set a timer for
1422.419,9.961,10 minutes what's the weather today what
1428.24,14.309,about tomorrow show me John Legend on
1432.38,14.85,Twitter get a lift ride to my hotel turn
1442.549,7.161,the flashlight on turn it off take a
1447.23,2.48,selfie
1455.24,11.41,all right now as you could see yeah I've
1463.14,6.33,often Meggie was able to open and
1466.65,4.47,navigate apps instantly now you might
1469.47,3.63,have also noticed that with continued
1471.12,4.44,conversation she was able to make
1473.1,5.97,several requests in a row without having
1475.56,5.1,to say hey Google each time now beyond
1479.07,3.27,an effortless way to operate your phone
1480.66,4.23,you can start to imagine how the
1482.34,5.97,assistant fused into the device could
1484.89,5.13,orchestrate tasks across apps let's look
1488.31,3.99,at another demo where Meg is chatting
1490.02,5.1,with a friend he's gonna ask her about a
1492.3,5.25,recent trip noticed how easy it is for
1495.12,11.34,her to respond with her voice and even
1497.55,12.65,share a photo reply had a great time
1506.46,3.74,with my family and it was so beautiful
1510.83,8.34,show me my photos from Yellowstone the
1516.3,2.87,ones with animals
1521.83,3.38,send it to Justin
1534.7,3.929,now another example is when a friend
1536.619,4.591,asks you a question and you need to look
1538.629,3.75,up the information to respond Justin
1541.21,3.69,wanted to know when Maggie's flight
1542.379,4.311,arrives when's my flight
1544.9,5.33,[Music]
1546.69,3.54,when's my flight
1552.86,4.49,reply I should get in around 1 p.m.
1557.74,5.65,alright so notice how it helped Maggie
1560.32,6.03,multitask more easily across different
1563.39,5.37,apps saving her a lot of back-and-forth
1566.35,4.449,now you can even imagine this next
1568.76,5.009,generation assistant handling more
1570.799,7.651,complex speech scenarios like composing
1573.769,12,and sending an email hey Google send an
1578.45,9.15,email to Jessica hi Jessica I just got
1585.769,5.701,back from Yellowstone and completely
1587.6,8.37,fell in love with it set subject to
1591.47,6.179,Yellowstone adventures let me know if
1595.97,7.309,next weekend works for dinner so I can
1597.649,5.63,tell you all about it send it
1610.85,4.47,now as you can see this required the
1613.279,4.441,assistant to understand when Maggie was
1615.32,4.229,dictating part of the message versus
1617.72,6.47,when she was asking it to complete an
1619.549,4.641,action thanks Maggie thanks Scott
1626.649,5.86,by moving these powerful AI models right
1630.169,4.771,onto your phone we're envisioning a
1632.509,4.861,paradigm shift this next generation
1634.94,4.589,assistant will let you instantly operate
1637.37,5.01,your phone with your voice multitask
1639.529,6.451,across apps and complete complex actions
1642.38,5.46,all with nearly zero latency and actions
1645.98,3.75,like turning on the flashlight opening
1647.84,4.53,Gmail or checking your calendar will
1649.73,4.26,even work offline now it's a very hard
1652.37,4.08,problem we've been solving and I'm
1653.99,5.01,really excited to share the realization
1656.45,5.309,of this vision is not far off in fact
1659,7.17,this next generation assistant is coming
1661.759,7.781,to the new pixel phones later this year
1666.17,5.35,[Applause]
1669.54,4.92,now our missions to make the assistant
1671.52,5.49,the best way to get things done you just
1674.46,4.5,saw how we're making it much faster but
1677.01,4.83,it also has to be personal enough to
1678.96,4.709,really help you now personalize helps
1681.84,4.53,especially important in areas where
1683.669,5.161,people's preferences completely differ
1686.37,4.95,like choosing what to listen to what to
1688.83,4.77,do on the weekend or even what to eat so
1691.32,5.09,let's look at a recipe example hey
1693.6,6.39,google what should I cook for dinner
1696.41,5.86,here are some recipe pics for you now as
1699.99,5.1,you can see the assistant picked recipes
1702.27,4.68,tailored to me for example it suggested
1705.09,3.48,a bourbon chicken recipe because it's
1706.95,4.38,helped me with barbecue recipes in the
1708.57,5.099,past now what I really love is that
1711.33,4.89,different people get completely
1713.669,5.161,different results we call this feature
1716.22,4.26,picks for you and it will be launching
1718.83,4.38,on smart displays later this summer
1720.48,6.03,starting with recipes podcasts and
1723.21,5.099,events now beyond your preferences
1726.51,3.93,becoming more personal means the
1728.309,4.201,assistant will better understand the
1730.44,4.2,people places and events that are
1732.51,3.99,important to you now one important
1734.64,4.409,person in my life is my mom who I'm
1736.5,4.83,gonna visit right after i/o so let's say
1739.049,4.681,I ask my assistant how's the traffic to
1741.33,5.52,mom's house and we all understand what I
1743.73,5.37,mean by mom's house right well if I'm in
1746.85,5.459,Toledo mom's house might have meant this
1749.1,5.4,place a non-profit childcare center in
1752.309,4.651,other cities mom's house can be a
1754.5,4.29,restaurant or a grocery store in fact
1756.96,5.58,there's lots of things in the world
1758.79,5.67,called mom's house now in linguistics
1762.54,4.29,the process is figuring out which thing
1764.46,4.709,a phrase refers to is called reference
1766.83,5.19,resolution and it's fundamental to
1769.169,4.351,understanding human language at Google
1772.02,3.3,we approach this problem using our
1773.52,4.409,knowledge graph of things in the world
1775.32,4.26,and their relationships it's what allows
1777.929,3.231,us to understand something like the
1779.58,4.8,Starbucks near the Golden Gate Bridge
1781.16,5.62,today we're expanding the assistants
1784.38,4.56,ability to understand you better by
1786.78,4.92,applying those same techniques to the
1788.94,5.4,things in your world we call it personal
1791.7,4.92,references so if I shared my mom's
1794.34,4.17,contact info with the assistant I can
1796.62,4.59,ask hey Google what's the weather like
1798.51,3.08,at Mom's house this weekend Friday and
1801.21,3.11,Saturday
1801.59,5.069,carmichael will be partly cloudy how
1804.32,4.68,long will take to get there with light
1806.659,5.041,traffic it will take you 2 hours and 14
1809,4.83,minutes to get to 123 Main Street by car
1811.7,4.589,remind me to order flowers a week before
1813.83,5.4,mom's birthday alright I'll remind you
1816.289,5.25,on July 3rd and it goes beyond mom
1819.23,4.29,if you've shared important people places
1821.539,3.841,and events with the assistant you'll be
1823.52,4.35,able to ask for things more naturally
1825.38,4.74,like show me photos of my son or
1827.87,4.71,directions to the restaurant reservation
1830.12,5.1,or remind me to pick up chocolates on my
1832.58,5.219,anniversary and rest assured you're
1835.22,4.92,always in control you can edit or delete
1837.799,5.901,this information at any time in the
1840.14,5.88,updated you tab in assistant settings
1843.7,4.859,now one place where the assistant can be
1846.02,5.97,especially helpful is in the car
1848.559,5.35,offering a safer hands-free way to get
1851.99,4.169,everything you need while you're on the
1853.909,3.661,road now we've been focused on the main
1856.159,3.211,things that we all want when we're
1857.57,4.079,driving to get where we're going safely
1859.37,3.98,to catch up with friends and to listen
1861.649,3.871,to something interesting along the way
1863.35,4.569,last year we brought the assistant to
1865.52,4.47,Android auto and earlier this year we
1867.919,5.071,added it to navigation in Google Maps
1869.99,6.24,I'm happy to share the assistant is also
1872.99,5.309,coming to ways in the next few weeks now
1876.23,3.66,I'd like to show you the future of how
1878.299,4.321,we're improving your mobile driving
1879.89,5.88,experience even more introducing the
1882.62,5.37,assistance new driving mode just put
1885.77,5.73,your phone in the car and say hey Google
1887.99,5.28,let's drive driving mode has a
1891.5,3.99,thoughtfully designed dashboard that
1893.27,4.2,brings your most relevant activities
1895.49,4.679,front and center while you're driving
1897.47,5.52,and includes suggestions personalized
1900.169,4.74,for you for example if you have a dinner
1902.99,4.23,reservation on your calendar you'll see
1904.909,4.921,a convenient shortcut to navigate to the
1907.22,4.77,restaurant or if you started a podcast
1909.83,4.589,at home in the morning once you get in
1911.99,4.559,your car it'll display a shortcut to
1914.419,4.98,resume the episode right where you left
1916.549,5.281,off now it also highlights top contacts
1919.399,5.071,making easy to call them or message them
1921.83,6.06,and recommendations for other things to
1924.47,5.85,listen to now once your navigating phone
1927.89,4.95,calls and music appear in a low-profile
1930.32,4.469,way so you can get things done without
1932.84,6.4,leaving your navigation screen
1934.789,6.25,hey Google play some jazz sure
1939.24,5.88,check out this jazz music station on
1941.039,6.601,YouTube music now everything is voice
1945.12,3.99,enabled so if a call comes in the
1947.64,4.019,assistant will tell you who's calling
1949.11,6.24,and ask if you want to answer without
1951.659,7.191,having to take your eyes off the road do
1955.35,6.11,you want to pick it up no thanks but

1971.039,9.571,this summer on any Android phone with
1973.59,9.719,the assistant now today the Google
1980.61,6.12,assistant is available on over 1 billion
1983.309,6.72,devices in over 30 languages across 80
1986.73,5.669,countries and with duplex on the web the
1990.029,4.801,next generation assistant personalized
1992.399,4.621,help and assistant it's in the car we're
1994.83,4.979,continuing to build on our mission to be
1997.02,5.909,the fastest most personal way to help

2104.349,5.02,thanks God it's great to see the
2107,5.819,momentum of Google assistant and how its
2109.369,5.581,able to help users get things done so
2112.819,5.01,far we've talked about building a more
2114.95,6.149,helpful Google it's equally important to
2117.829,5.611,us that we do this for everyone for
2121.099,5.7,everyone is a core philosophy for us at
2123.44,6.21,Google that's why from the earliest days
2126.799,5.701,search works the same whether you're a
2129.65,6.51,professor at Stanford or a student in
2132.5,6.329,rural Indonesia it's why we build
2136.16,5.76,affordable laptops for classrooms
2138.829,5.821,everywhere and it's why we care about
2141.92,5.369,the experience on low-cost phones in
2144.65,5.939,countries where users are just starting
2147.289,6.391,to come online with the same passion as
2150.589,5.73,we do with premium phones and it goes
2153.68,4.71,beyond our products and services it's
2156.319,4.53,why we offer free training and tools
2158.39,5.669,through grow at Google helping people
2160.849,6.061,grow their skills find jobs and build
2164.059,5.97,their businesses and it's how we develop
2166.91,6.149,our technology ensuring the responsible
2170.029,4.32,development of AI privacy and security
2173.059,4.441,that works for everyone
2174.349,6.18,and products that are accessible at
2177.5,6.63,their core let's start with building AI
2180.529,5.881,for everyone bias has been a concern in
2184.13,4.83,science long before machine learning
2186.41,5.76,came along but the stakes are clearly
2188.96,6.839,higher with AI it's not enough to know
2192.17,7.199,if your model works we need to know how
2195.799,7.53,it works we want to ensure that our AI
2199.369,6.45,models don't reinforce bias that exists
2203.329,4.71,in the real world it's a hard problem
2205.819,5.19,which is why we are doing fundamental
2208.039,5.191,computer science research to improve the
2211.009,4.741,transparency of machine learning models
2213.23,5.4,and reduce bias let me show you what I
2215.75,5.279,mean when computer scientists deploy
2218.63,5.34,machine learning models it can sometimes
2221.029,5.58,be difficult to understand why they make
2223.97,5.129,a certain prediction that's because most
2226.609,5.7,machine learning models appear to
2229.099,5.91,operate on lower level features edges
2232.309,4.051,and lines in a picture color of a single
2235.009,2.761,pixel
2236.36,3.96,that's very different than the
2237.77,7.83,higher-level concepts more familiar to
2240.32,5.97,humans like stripes on a zebra to tackle
2245.6,3.27,this problem
2246.29,5.76,googly-eye researchers are working on a
2248.87,6.15,new methodology called decaf or testing
2252.05,5.52,with concept activation vectors let me
2255.02,5.54,give you an example if it's a machine
2257.57,5.91,learning model trained to detect zebras
2260.56,5.11,you would want to know which variables
2263.48,5.4,were being used to decide if the image
2265.67,5.52,contained a zebra or not decaf can help
2268.88,4.23,you understand if the concept of stripes
2271.19,5.76,was important to the models prediction
2273.11,5.55,in this particular case it makes sense
2276.95,6.51,stripes are an important predictor for
2278.66,7.59,the model now suppose a classifier was
2283.46,5.43,trained on pictures of doctors if the
2286.25,6,training data was mostly males wearing
2288.89,6.18,coats and stethoscopes then the model
2292.25,5.69,could inaccurately assume that being
2295.07,5.43,male was an important prediction factor
2297.94,6.55,there are other important examples as
2300.5,6.96,well now imagine an AI system that could
2304.49,5.94,help with detecting skin cancer to be
2307.46,5.42,effective it would need to recognize a
2310.43,5.21,vied variety of skin tones
2312.88,6.31,representative of the entire population
2315.64,5.68,there's a lot more to do but we are
2319.19,6.32,committed to building AI in a way that's
2321.32,6.66,fair and works for everyone including
2325.51,6.16,identifying and addressing bias in our
2327.98,7.8,own ml models and sharing tools and open
2331.67,6.48,datasets to help you as well another way
2335.78,4.23,we built for everyone is by ensuring
2338.15,4.56,that our products are safe and private
2340.01,5.46,and that people have clear meaningful
2342.71,5.58,choices around their data we strongly
2345.47,6.63,believe that privacy and security are
2348.29,5.97,for everyone not just a few this is why
2352.1,3.69,powerful privacy features and controls
2354.26,4.86,have always been built into Google
2355.79,6.66,services we launched incognito mode in
2359.12,5.31,chrome over a decade ago the pioneered
2362.45,5.55,Google takeout which gives you easy
2364.43,6.12,controls to export your data from email
2368,6.45,contacts photos all of our
2370.55,6.39,anytime you choose to but we know our
2374.45,5.22,work on privacy and security is never
2376.94,4.98,done and we want to do more to stay
2379.67,4.83,ahead of constantly evolving user
2381.92,4.65,expectations we've been working on a
2384.5,6,significant set of enhancements and I
2386.57,6.69,want to talk you through a few today you
2390.5,4.8,can already find all your privacy and
2393.26,5.61,security settings in one place in your
2395.3,6.27,Google account to make sure your Google
2398.87,5.34,account is always at your fingertips we
2401.57,5.61,are making it easily accessible from
2404.21,5.97,your profile photo if you're in search
2407.18,5.52,you can tap on your photo and you can
2410.18,5.46,quickly access the most relevant privacy
2412.7,6.33,controls for search in case your data in
2415.64,6.54,search here you can view and manage your
2419.03,7.26,recent activity and you can easily
2422.18,7.71,change your privacy settings last week
2426.29,5.55,we announced auto-delete controls which
2429.89,5.49,you'll all also be able to access right
2431.84,6.78,from that data helps make search work
2435.38,5.22,better for you and with auto-delete you
2438.62,6.2,can choose how long you want it to be
2440.6,7.8,saved for example 3 or 18 months after
2444.82,5.29,which any old data will be automatically
2448.4,3.05,and continuously deleted from your
2450.11,4.5,account
2451.45,5.32,this is launching today for web and app
2454.61,4.2,activity we'll be rolling it out to
2456.77,4.44,location history in the coming weeks and
2458.81,5.52,we'll continue to bring features such as
2461.21,6.21,this to more controls over time in
2464.33,4.95,addition one tap access to your Google
2467.42,5.45,account will be coming to our major
2469.28,7.77,products including chrome search
2472.87,8.2,assistant YouTube Google News and maps
2477.05,5.01,and speaking of maps if you tap on your
2481.07,3.54,profile photo
2482.06,4.77,in addition defining easy access to your
2484.61,5.55,privacy controls you'll find a new
2486.83,5.07,feature incognito mode incognito mode as
2490.16,3.93,a pop has been a popular feature in
2491.9,4.71,chrome since it launched and we are
2494.09,5.55,bringing this to maps while in incognito
2496.61,5.79,in maps your activity like the places
2499.64,4.26,you search and navigate to won't be
2502.4,4.02,linked to your account
2503.9,5.13,we want to make it easy to enter in and
2506.42,5.79,out of incognito and maps will soon join
2509.03,5.31,Chrome and YouTube with support for
2512.21,13.86,incognito and we'll be bringing it to
2514.34,15.3,search as well this year another way we
2526.07,6.3,ensure your privacy is by working hard
2529.64,4.68,to keep your data secure from Safe
2532.37,4.56,Browsing which now protects over four
2534.32,4.47,billion devices every day to using
2536.93,3.6,tensorflow to significantly reduce
2538.79,5.25,phishing attacks in Gmail
2540.53,6.27,we also encourage users to use 2-step
2544.04,6.45,verification because an additional layer
2546.8,5.88,of protection is always helpful today we
2550.49,4.74,are making 2-step verification even more
2552.68,5.04,convenient for everyone by bringing the
2555.23,5.25,protection of security keys directly
2557.72,5.87,into your Android phone so now you can
2560.48,6.06,confirm a sign-in with just a tap and
2563.59,6.39,today it'll be available to over 1
2566.54,3.44,billion compatible devices
2571.03,7.52,[Applause]
2574.41,7.32,we always want to do more for users but
2578.55,4.95,do it with less data over time so we are
2581.73,4.05,applying the same cutting-edge VI
2583.5,5.52,research that makes our products better
2585.78,7.44,and applying it to your hands user
2589.02,6.69,privacy federated learning this is a new
2593.22,5.31,approach to machine learning developed
2595.71,5.7,by Google is one example it allows
2598.53,5.58,Google's AI products to work better for
2601.41,5.75,you and work better for everyone without
2604.11,7.11,collecting raw data from your device's
2607.16,6.04,instead of selling data to the cloud we
2611.22,5.22,flip the model we ship machine learning
2613.2,6,models directly to your device each
2616.44,6,phone computes an update to the global
2619.2,7.14,model and only those updates not the
2622.44,6.24,data is securely uploaded and aggregated
2626.34,5.43,in large batches to improve the global
2628.68,6.33,model and then the updated global model
2631.77,6.15,is sent back to everyone's device let me
2635.01,6.39,explain it with a concrete example take
2637.92,5.76,G board Google's keyboard using on
2641.4,5.31,device learning alone when new words
2643.68,4.86,become popular G board would not be able
2646.71,2.84,to suggest them until you have typed
2648.54,4.08,them many times
2649.55,6.79,federated learning however allows G
2652.62,7.02,board to learn new words like BTS or
2656.34,5.43,Yolo after thousands of people start
2659.64,4.95,using them without Google ever seeing
2661.77,6.09,anything you type actually with BTS is
2664.59,5.82,probably millions of people this is not
2667.86,5.34,just research in fact G board is already
2670.41,5.28,using federated learning to improve next
2673.2,4.95,word prediction as well as emoji
2675.69,5.76,prediction across tens of millions of
2678.15,5.28,devices it's still very early but we are
2681.45,4.74,excited about the progress and the
2683.43,6.65,potential of federated learning across
2686.19,3.89,many more of our products
2694.33,4.39,privacy and security are the foundation
2696.74,4.59,for all the work we do and will continue
2698.72,5.33,to push the boundaries of technology to
2701.33,5.91,make it even better for our users
2704.05,5.53,building for everyone also means
2707.24,5.52,ensuring that everyone can access our
2709.58,6.09,products the World Health Organization
2712.76,6.27,estimates that 15 percent of the world's
2715.67,6.96,population over 1 billion people has a
2719.03,6.87,disability we believe technology can
2722.63,5.19,help us be more inclusive and AI is
2725.9,4.53,providing us with new tools to
2727.82,5.27,dramatically improve experience for
2730.43,5.55,people with disabilities for example
2733.09,5.59,there are almost 500 million people in
2735.98,5.19,the world who are deaf or hard of
2738.68,5.34,hearing think of how many conversations
2741.17,5.49,are challenging from in person
2744.02,6.78,discussions and phone calls to even
2746.66,7.8,experiencing videos online a few months
2750.8,7.14,ago we launched live transcribe powered
2754.46,6.66,by Google's cloud speech API to caption
2757.94,5.64,conversations in real time you can leave
2761.12,5.16,your phone open with the app and when
2763.58,5.4,someone speaks to you it transcribes
2766.28,6.21,their speech into text those who cannot
2768.98,6.63,or prefer not to speak can also respond
2772.49,5.67,by typing was really inspired by how the
2775.61,5.97,product came about to offer our Google
2778.16,5.22,researchers Dimitri and Chet saw an
2781.58,3.53,opportunity to help people and
2783.38,4.53,collaborate it to develop the app
2785.11,6.52,together with a small team of engineers
2787.91,6.39,and people who volunteered their 20%
2791.63,4.86,time they built live transcribe and it
2794.3,6.14,is now available in over 70 languages
2796.49,3.95,and dialects on Android devices
2801.12,5.729,[Applause]
2803.39,5.86,today we are going further and extending
2806.849,5.581,this technology we are announcing a new
2809.25,6.24,feature called live caption live caption
2812.43,5.329,makes all content no matter its origin
2815.49,4.349,more accessible to everyone
2817.759,4.681,incredible thing is that it works
2819.839,6.27,completely on device so there's no delay
2822.44,7.599,with one click you can turn on captions
2826.109,22.44,for a web video podcast or even on a
2830.039,20.73,moment you capture at home only possible
2848.549,5.04,due to our recent breakthroughs in
2850.769,5.371,speech recognition technology we
2853.589,7.44,recently tested live caption with some
2856.14,7.8,uses let's take a look this volume
2861.029,15.06,button here and then we turn on that
2863.94,16.05,button amazing it feels like wow it's
2876.089,5.881,such a simple feature but it has such an
2879.99,4.289,impact on me it's gonna make our lives
2881.97,4.2,so much easier I wake up two o'clock in
2884.279,3.921,the morning to walk so wake up my mom or
2886.17,2.03,dad
2891.84,3.5,[Applause]
2895.64,5.5,you can imagine all the use cases for
2898.53,5.58,the broader community - for example the
2901.14,5.4,ability to watch any video if you're in
2904.11,4.92,a meeting or on the subway without
2906.54,3.96,disturbing the people around you the
2909.03,3.3,Android team is going to talk a little
2910.5,4.74,bit later today about what made live
2912.33,5.25,caption possible we are also exploring
2915.24,5.01,how this technology can caption phone
2917.58,5.97,calls but we want to go one step further
2920.25,6.78,and actually allow more people to
2923.55,6.99,respond and accomplish tasks over their
2927.03,6.78,phones as you see in this example Nicole
2930.54,6.3,who is deaf and prefers not to speak can
2933.81,6.09,receive a call from her hairstylist with
2936.84,5.61,smart compose and smart reply she can
2939.9,9.42,answer the call and interact let's take
2942.45,8.64,a look hi this is Nicole's assistive
2949.32,3.33,Chat she'll see what you say and her
2951.09,2.69,responses will be read back to you
2952.65,6.99,starting now
2953.78,10.78,hi Nicole its Jaime how are you hey
2959.64,6.18,Jaime I'm good and you great are we
2964.56,9.27,still on for your 1:00 p.m. haircut
2965.82,10.44,tomorrow sorry can you do 3 p.m. uh yes
2973.83,6.32,I can do 3 p.m. we have a lot to catch
2976.26,6.05,up on I want to hear all about your trip
2980.15,6.58,perfect thumbs up
2982.31,6.78,great see you tomorrow bye thumbs up
2986.73,3.65,indeed
2989.09,3.969,[Applause]
2990.38,6.01,[Music]
2993.059,5.891,we call this new technology live relay
2996.39,5.439,while there's still more work to do
2998.95,5.49,we are excited to see how it can help
3001.829,5.881,people like Nicole get things done more
3004.44,5.79,easily just like with live caption this
3007.71,5.67,runs completely on device and these
3010.23,4.769,conversations remain private to you we
3013.38,4.439,also want to help those with speech
3014.999,6.77,disorders or people whose speech has
3017.819,7.05,been affected by a stroke or ALS
3021.769,5.29,researchers from google AI are exploring
3024.869,4.561,the idea of personalized communication
3027.059,5.19,models that can better understand
3029.43,6.329,different types of speech as well as how
3032.249,7.02,a I can help even those who cannot speak
3035.759,14.371,to communicate we call this research
3039.269,18.74,project Dafoe Nia let's take a look but
3050.13,7.879,it is not fun it will not offend to you
3058.549,5.171,no one's ever Co active large datasets
3061.019,7.401,of people whose speech is hard for
3063.72,10.799,others to understand we're okay working
3068.42,8.109,for GF who cuts so bad ever they're not
3074.519,6.081,used in training the speech recognition
3076.529,6.841,models the game is is to record things
3080.6,5.13,and then have it recognized things that
3083.37,7.8,you say that aren't in the trainings
3085.73,7.42,"you're Dimitri recorded 15,000 phrase it"
3091.17,6.89,wasn't obvious that this was going to
3093.15,4.91,work he just sat there he kept recording
3098.63,13.71,all interactive devices able to
3104.75,7.59,understand any person who speaks to them
3112.4,6.01,you can see that it's possible to make a
3115.44,4.65,speech recognizer to work for Dimitri it
3118.41,3.66,should be possible to make it work for
3120.09,3.27,many people even people if you can't
3122.07,2.85,speak because they've lost the ability
3123.36,4.25,to speak the work that Zhang Sheng is
3124.92,8.88,done on you know voice utterances from
3127.61,7.78,sounds alone you can communicate but
3133.8,2.31,there might be other ways of
3135.39,3.87,communicating
3136.11,5.85,most people with ALS end up using an
3139.26,5.09,on-screen keyboard and having to type
3141.96,3.87,each individual letter with their eyes
3144.35,5.83,for me
3145.83,5.88,communicating is Steve Mike crack a joke
3150.18,3.27,and it's related to something that
3151.71,3.59,happened you know a few minutes ago the
3153.45,4.38,idea is to create a tool so that Steve
3155.3,4.66,constrain machine learning models him
3157.83,3.95,stone to understand his facial
3159.96,5.529,expressions
3161.78,6.299,[Applause]
3165.489,5.8,to be able to laugh to be able to cheer
3168.079,6.12,to be able to boo things that seem maybe
3171.289,5.67,so worthless but actually aren't so core
3174.199,4.02,to human I still think this is only the
3176.959,3.75,tip of the iceberg we're not even
3178.219,3.63,scratching the surface yet of what is
3180.709,2.85,possible if we can get speech
3181.849,3.42,recognizers to work with small numbers
3183.559,3.54,of people who were in lessons which we
3185.269,4.8,can then combine to build something that
3187.099,8.51,really works for everyone but understand
3190.069,5.54,we understood the absolute I'm doing
3205.26,4.93,we are working hard to provide these
3207.88,4.86,voice recognition models through the
3210.19,4.74,Google Assistant in the future but as
3212.74,4.59,you saw in Dimitri's case this will only
3214.93,5.85,be possible with many more speech
3217.33,6.63,samples to train our models on if you or
3220.78,5.7,someone you know has slurred or hard to
3223.96,5.46,understand speech we'd like to invite
3226.48,6.66,you to submit voice samples to help
3229.42,7.17,accelerate this effort fundamentally I
3233.14,6.15,research which enables new products for
3236.59,6.029,people with disabilities is an important
3239.29,6.84,way we drive our mission forward live
3242.619,7.141,transcribe live caption live relay and
3246.13,6.32,project fo Nia will ultimately result in
3249.76,5.52,products that work better for all of us
3252.45,6.01,it's a perfect example of what we mean
3255.28,6.42,by building a more helpful Google for
3258.46,6.33,everyone one of the most powerful ways
3261.7,4.97,we deliver help to our users is through
3264.79,4.65,our open source platforms like Android
3266.67,4.85,to tell you more I'd like to invite
3269.44,9.779,Stefan to the stage
3271.52,7.699,[Music]
3280.15,10.3,it's amazing we're here to talk about
3282.2,10.8,Androids version 10 and we get to
3290.45,5.73,celebrate a milestone together today
3293,10.41,there are over 2.5 billion active
3296.18,9.659,Android devices and today we want to
3303.41,6.24,walk you through what's coming next in
3305.839,6.121,Android queue innovation security and
3309.65,6.689,privacy the central theme of the Q
3311.96,6.42,release and digital well-being a lot has
3316.339,4.591,changed since one dot o smartphones have
3318.38,5.209,evolved from an early vision to this
3320.93,5.55,integral tool in our lives and they are
3323.589,5.141,incredibly helpful looking ahead we see
3326.48,5.52,another big wave of innovation coming to
3328.73,5.19,make them even more helpful QED shows
3332,4.559,Android shaping the leading edge of
3333.92,4.98,mobile innovation with over a hundred
3336.559,5.071,and eighty device makers around the
3338.9,4.83,world driven by this powerful ecosystem
3341.63,4.949,many innovations have been first on
3343.73,5.849,Android from large screens to the first
3346.579,5.431,OLED display and this year display
3349.579,4.561,technology will take an even bigger leap
3352.01,5.609,with foldables coming from multiple
3354.14,6.81,Android OMS these devices open up a
3357.619,5.521,completely new category which though
3360.95,4.889,early just might change the future of
3363.14,4.26,mobile computing foldables take
3365.839,3.931,advantage of a completely new display
3367.4,4.53,technology they literally Bend and fold
3369.77,5.339,from phone to tablet sized screen and
3371.93,5.85,cue maximizes what's possible on these
3375.109,5.401,screens for instance foldables are great
3377.78,4.92,for multitasking so I can watch some
3380.51,3.66,funny videos my sister sent me while we
3382.7,5.07,chat about what we're gonna do for my
3384.17,6.12,mom on mother's day but the feature I'm
3387.77,4.68,most excited about is screen continuity
3390.29,4.2,so let's say we finished chatting it's
3392.45,4.23,time to head out and I'm standing around
3394.49,5.099,waiting for my ride so I start playing a
3396.68,6.6,game on the folded smaller screen when I
3399.589,5.581,sit down and unfold the game seamlessly
3403.28,4.44,transfers to the larger screen it is so
3405.17,5.37,cool and I can pick up exactly where I
3407.72,5.58,was playing now multiple OMS will launch
3410.54,12.9,foldables this year all run
3413.3,14.07,Android another exciting innovation is 5
3423.44,7.41,g 5g networks mean consistently faster
3427.37,5.7,speeds with lower latency so apps and
3430.85,5.04,especially games can target rich
3433.07,5.49,immersive experiences to these 5g
3435.89,6.06,connected phones and Android Q supports
3438.56,5.73,5g natively this year more than 20
3441.95,5.58,carriers will launch networks and our
3444.29,5.7,OEMs have over a dozen 5g ready phones
3447.53,5.79,all launching this year and they'll all
3449.99,5.31,be running Android now in addition to
3453.32,4.68,hardware innovation we're also seeing
3455.3,5.85,huge firsts in software driven by
3458,6.12,advances in on device machine learning
3461.15,4.74,center showed live caption now I would
3464.12,3.63,really like you to see it in action
3465.89,4.07,and then take you under the hood please
3467.75,5.78,welcome Tristan
3469.96,6.46,[Applause]
3473.53,5.71,like many people I watch videos without
3476.42,4.68,sound when I'm on the go with captions I
3479.24,3.93,can still keep up even if I'm in a
3481.1,5.67,crowded space I'm sitting in a meeting
3483.17,6.03,so for me they're super helpful but for
3486.77,3.99,the almost 500 million people who are
3489.2,5.34,deaf or hard of hearing
3490.76,6.09,captions are critical today loads of
3494.54,4.44,mobile content embeds audio from video
3496.85,2.6,to voice messages and everything in
3498.98,3.33,between
3499.45,6.58,without captions this content is nowhere
3502.31,6.3,near as accessible live caption in Q
3506.03,5.16,takes audio and instantly turns it into
3508.61,4.62,text let's take a look at this video my
3511.19,5.34,friend Heather sent me yesterday to turn
3513.23,16.32,it on I open the volume rocker and tap
3516.53,15.33,the live caption body is walking away so
3529.55,4.68,as you can see these captions appear in
3531.86,5.16,real-time over a video that would
3534.23,6,normally never have captions you can
3537.02,6.24,expand them contract them move them up
3540.23,5.73,and down it's a lot of fun but what
3543.26,5.1,makes this feature so incredible is that
3545.96,3.39,it's entirely done on device in fact it
3548.36,4.83,doesn't need to be connected to the
3549.35,7.76,Internet at all if we take a look this
3553.19,3.92,entire demo I've done in airplane mode
3557.71,6.2,thank you thank you
3560.69,5.559,okay so how is this possible it's
3563.91,4.53,because of a huge breakthrough in speech
3566.249,2.731,recognition that we made earlier this
3568.44,2.97,year
3568.98,4.74,this one's required streaming audio to
3571.41,4.74,the cloud to run a two gigabyte model
3573.72,5.339,for processing now we can do that same
3576.15,6,processing on device using a recurrent
3579.059,5.19,neural net in just 80 megabytes the live
3582.15,5.669,speech model is running on the phone and
3584.249,6.09,no audio stream ever leaves it all this
3587.819,4.02,protects user privacy and this is OS
3590.339,4.49,wide which means you get those captions
3591.839,5.401,in all your apps and in web content too
3594.829,4.871,now the same on device machine-learning
3597.24,5.67,powers another useful cue feature which
3599.7,5.159,is smart reply with smart reply the OS
3602.91,4.56,helpfully suggests what you'll type next
3604.859,5.4,it'll predict the text you'll type even
3607.47,4.68,emoji and it's a huge time-saver what's
3610.259,4.86,really cool is this works now for all
3612.15,4.679,messaging apps and Android like in
3615.119,3.841,signal you can see the OS providing
3616.829,4.53,these helpful suggestions and smart
3618.96,4.44,reply can now even predict the actions
3621.359,2.821,that you'll take so say a friend sends
3623.4,2.609,you an address
3624.18,3.929,and normally you copy and paste that
3626.009,3.631,into maps that's kind of a hassle with
3628.109,4.051,smart reply you just tap and it will
3629.64,5.429,open for you and all this is saving you
3632.16,4.409,time on device machine learning powers
3635.069,3.361,everything from these incredible
3636.569,3.45,breakthroughs like live caption to
3638.43,4.379,helpful everyday features like smart
3640.019,5.611,reply and it does this with no user
3642.809,6.81,input ever leaving the phone all of
3645.63,5.28,which protects user privacy now there's
3649.619,2.611,one more addition to Android cue that's
3650.91,3.899,small but you've been asking us about
3652.23,5.539,for a while and that is dark theme and
3654.809,2.96,we're launching it and cue
3661.05,4.18,so you can activate it by using the
3663.609,3.391,quick tile or by turning on battery
3665.23,3.93,saver and in fact it will help you save
3667,4.32,battery your OLED display is one of the
3669.16,4.439,most power hungry components in your
3671.32,4.83,phone so by lighting up less pixels will
3673.599,5.791,save you battery so that's innovation
3676.15,5.78,but we feel all innovation must happen
3679.39,5.61,within a frame of security and privacy
3681.93,5.62,people now carry phones constantly and
3685,5.43,we trust them with a lot of personal
3687.55,5.549,information you should always be in
3690.43,5.07,control of what you share and who you
3693.099,4.681,share it with and that's why the central
3695.5,4.68,a second area will cover and the central
3697.78,5.61,focus of the release is security and
3700.18,5.16,privacy now over the years androids
3703.39,5.16,built out a huge set of protections
3705.34,6.269,already file based encryption SSL by
3708.55,6.12,default security and s work profiles and
3711.609,5.271,many of these were first on Android and
3714.67,5.1,Android has the most widely deployed
3716.88,6.91,security and anti-malware service of any
3719.77,6.72,OS with Google Play protect it runs on
3723.79,7.799,every device and it scans over 50
3726.49,7.47,billion apps a day in fact in Gartner's
3731.589,6.141,2019 security report which was published
3733.96,7.159,this week Android scored the highest
3737.73,6.43,possible rating in 26 out of 30
3741.119,5.651,categories it's ahead on multiple points
3744.16,6.06,from authentication to network security
3746.77,5.849,to malware protection and more at the
3750.22,4.379,same time we wanted to go much further
3752.619,4.771,and that's why Android q' includes
3754.599,5.101,almost 50 features focused on security
3757.39,6.09,and privacy all providing more
3759.7,5.94,protection transparency and control so
3763.48,4.02,first in queue we brought privacy to the
3765.64,3.87,top level in settings and there you'll
3767.5,2.97,find a number of important controls all
3769.51,3.39,in one place
3770.47,5.99,activity data location history add
3772.9,6.15,settings and you decide what's on or off
3776.46,4.78,now location is another place we've
3779.05,4.68,created tools for more transparency and
3781.24,4.47,control now location can be really
3783.73,4.859,helpful especially when you're lost in a
3785.71,5.25,new place but it's also some of your
3788.589,4.411,most personal information and you should
3790.96,4.29,again always be in control
3793,5.55,of who you share it with and how they
3795.25,5.01,can use it so first if you're wondering
3798.55,4.38,which apps can be accessing your
3800.26,5.19,location we make it easy for you to know
3802.93,5.01,with Q your device will give you helpful
3805.45,4.32,reminders whenever an app accesses
3807.94,4.89,location when you're not actively using
3809.77,5.57,that app so you can review and decide do
3812.83,5.7,you want to continue sharing or not
3815.34,5.23,second Q will give you more control over
3818.53,4.56,how you share location data with apps
3820.57,4.44,for example say you want to get pizza
3823.09,4.83,delivered you can choose to share your
3825.01,6,location only while the app is in use
3827.92,6.33,and as soon as you close you'll stop
3831.01,4.83,sharing location finally what if you're
3834.25,3.39,wondering what kind of location do all
3835.84,3.66,my apps have in queue we've brought
3837.64,4.29,location controls to the forefront in
3839.5,4.71,settings so you can quickly review every
3841.93,5.31,app and change location access with
3844.21,4.62,simple controls now there are many many
3847.24,4.58,more enhancements to security and
3848.83,5.18,privacy throughout the OS like TLS v3
3851.82,4.39,encryption for low-end devices
3854.01,4.15,randomizing your MAC address by default
3856.21,4.89,and many more and you can read about all
3858.16,5.04,of these in our blog post this week but
3861.1,4.14,there's one more really big thing for
3863.2,4.47,security now your Android device gets
3865.24,3.54,regular up security updates already but
3867.67,3.39,you still have to wait for the release
3868.78,5.04,and you have to reboot when they come we
3871.06,5.52,want you to get these faster even faster
3873.82,6.51,and that's why in cue we're making a set
3876.58,5.79,of OS modules updatable directly over
3880.33,3.9,the air so now these can be updated
3882.37,2.49,individually as soon as they are
3884.23,4.67,available
3884.86,4.04,and without a reboot of the device
3893.18,4.169,now this was a huge technical challenge
3895.309,4.591,for updating these in the background the
3897.349,4.051,same way we're updating Google Apps it's
3899.9,3.33,easier for our partners with whom we're
3901.4,4.26,working closely but more importantly
3903.23,3.839,it's much better for you you can learn
3905.66,3.78,more about this at the session what's
3907.069,3.75,new in Android now there's one more
3909.44,2.31,thing that's changed since the early
3910.819,2.76,days of Android
3911.75,3.69,now people carry smartphones everywhere
3913.579,4.561,because they're really helpful but we're
3915.44,5.31,also spending a lot of time on phones
3918.14,5.04,and people tell us sometimes they wish
3920.75,4.65,they'd spent more time on other things
3923.18,5.639,we want to help people find balance and
3925.4,5.37,digital well-being and yes sometimes
3928.819,4.77,this means making it easier to put your
3930.77,5.009,device away entirely and focus on the
3933.589,4.02,times that really matter that's why last
3935.779,4.08,year we launched digital well-being
3937.609,4.771,tools which dashboards app timers
3939.859,4.561,flipped ashesh and winddown
3942.38,4.26,to help you set the phone down and get
3944.42,4.59,to sleep at night and these tools are
3946.64,4.979,really helping app timers helped users
3949.01,5.819,stick to their goals over 90% of the
3951.619,5.761,time and users of wind down had a 27
3954.829,4.5,percent drop in night time usage if
3957.38,4.53,you're not using these already I would
3959.329,4.77,really recommend them but this year we
3961.91,4.379,want to help even more with distraction
3964.099,4.23,a lot of times I just want to sit down
3966.289,3.75,and focus to get something done and when
3968.329,2.911,I'm trying to do this like working maybe
3970.039,2.911,it's studying for you
3971.24,3.66,I don't want email or anything else to
3972.95,5.28,distract me and that's why we've created
3974.9,6.24,a new mode for Android it's called focus
3978.23,4.68,mode when I enter focus mode I can
3981.14,4.679,select the apps that I find distracting
3982.91,3.99,for me that's email the news so now
3985.819,3.451,they're turned off and I could really
3986.9,4.59,get to work those apps that distract me
3989.27,3.599,are disabled but I can still keep text
3991.49,4.349,because it's important to me that my
3992.869,4.17,family can always get a hold of me until
3995.839,3.331,I come out of focus mode and then
3997.039,6.321,everything is back focus mode is coming
3999.17,8.63,to devices on P and Q this fall
4003.36,7.12,[Applause]
4007.8,6.27,now finally I want to talk about
4010.48,6.42,families for 84% of us parents
4014.07,5.77,technology used by our kids is a top
4016.9,5.57,concern in the US the average age of
4019.84,5.58,kids getting phones is now eight in
4022.47,5.08,queue family linked parental controls
4025.42,4.23,will be built right into the settings of
4027.55,4.23,the device so when you set up a device
4029.65,5.07,for someone in your family family link
4031.78,5.28,will help connect it to a parent and you
4034.72,5.58,can review any apps that your child
4037.06,5.73,wants to install after that you can set
4040.3,4.26,daily screen time limits you can check
4042.79,4.38,where the apps where my kids are
4044.56,5.07,spending time and you can set a device
4047.17,5.37,bedtime so your kids can disconnect and
4049.63,5.64,get to sleep and now in Android cue you
4052.54,4.68,can set time limits on specific apps and
4055.27,3.72,when your child hits light device
4057.22,6.08,bedtime if you want to give them just
4058.99,4.31,five more minutes now we have Bonus Time
4065.67,3.52,now there's a ton more in queue that we
4067.75,3.45,don't have time to cover a ton
4069.19,4.11,everything from streaming media to
4071.2,5.04,hearing aids to better connectivity to
4073.3,5.28,new gesture UI and more so today I'm
4076.24,6.69,excited to announce that cue beta 3 is
4078.58,10.35,available on 21 devices that is twelve
4082.93,8.37,OEMs plus all pixels and that is more
4088.93,3.66,than double last year we hope you head
4091.3,2.85,over to the link to get it on your phone
4092.59,3.9,because we would love to have you try it
4094.15,11.31,out and now I will hand it over to Rick

4685.739,5.91,your home as I said earlier there's a
4689.219,4.71,fundamental difference between a smart

4715.59,5.76,helpful smartphone experience to more
4718.53,6.78,people a core element of googles mission
4721.35,6.6,is to make technology more available and
4725.31,4.74,accessible for everyone and sundar said
4727.95,4.17,it earlier we need to ensure that
4730.05,4.44,technology benefits the many not just
4732.12,4.44,the few but there's been a really
4734.49,4.05,troubling trend in the smartphone
4736.56,2.79,industry to support the latest
4738.54,2.79,technologies
4739.35,5.88,everyone's high-end phones are getting
4741.33,5.91,more and more expensive so we challenged
4745.23,5.1,ourselves to see if we could optimize
4747.24,5.28,our software and AI to work great on
4750.33,4.29,more affordable Hardware so we can
4752.52,5.4,deliver these high-end experiences at a
4754.62,4.74,more accessible price point I want to
4757.92,4.14,introduce you to the newest members of
4759.36,5.13,the pixel family Google pixel 3a and 3a
4762.06,5.99,Excel designed to deliver premium
4764.49,3.56,features at a price people will love
4772.249,4.48,we didn't compromise on the capabilities
4775.26,3.629,and performance you'd expect from a
4776.729,6.51,premium device which is why we branded
4778.889,9.391,them pixel they start at just 399
4783.239,7.351,dollars it's about half the price half
4788.28,4.529,the price of typical flagship phones and
4790.59,5.119,I want to introduce Sabrina to tell you
4792.809,2.9,more about how we did it
4797.66,3.21,[Applause]
4798.71,6.39,[Music]
4800.87,7.5,thanks Rick delivering premium features
4805.1,6.51,with high performance on a phone at this
4808.37,6.12,price point it's been a huge engineering
4811.61,4.77,challenge and I'm really proud of what
4814.49,5.79,our team has been able to accomplish
4816.38,6.57,with pixel 3a so let's start with the
4820.28,4.89,design pixel 3a follows the design
4822.95,5.13,language of the pixel family the
4825.17,5.73,familiar two-tone look smooth finish and
4828.08,5.54,ergonomic unibody design it feels good
4830.9,6.06,in your hand and it looks beautiful
4833.62,6.3,pixel 3a comes in three colors just
4836.96,9.75,black clearly white and a new color
4839.92,9.19,purple-ish everything looks amazing on
4846.71,4.77,the vibrant OLED display and your music
4849.11,6.54,your podcasts they sound great in
4851.48,7.47,premium stereo sound pixel 3a supports
4855.65,6.9,Bluetooth 5.0 and USB C digital audio
4858.95,6.89,and we've also included a 3.5 millimeter
4862.55,3.29,audio jack
4868.07,8.07,because we've heard some people want
4871.37,7.59,more headphone options but what pixel is
4876.14,5.88,really known for is this incredible
4878.96,5.46,camera and with software optimizations
4882.02,4.77,we found a way to bring our exclusive
4884.42,6.54,camera features and our industry-leading
4886.79,7.01,image quality into pixel 3a so photos
4890.96,6.36,look stunning in any light
4893.8,6.85,what other smartphone cameras try to do
4897.32,6.84,with expensive hardware we can deliver
4900.65,6.75,with software and AI including high-end
4904.16,6.18,computational photography so here's what
4907.4,9.17,that means pixel 3a can take amazing
4910.34,6.23,photos in low light with night sights
4917.44,7.84,it's one of pixels most popular features
4921.969,8.5,we've also enabled pixels portrait mode
4925.28,8.04,on both the front and rear cameras and
4930.469,5.191,our super resume applies computational
4933.32,4.649,photography so you can get closer to
4935.66,5.73,your subject while still maintaining a
4937.969,5.341,high degree of resolution and all of
4941.39,6.62,your beautiful photos are backed up for
4943.31,4.7,free in high quality with Google photos
4951.31,5.8,pixel 3ei also has the helpful features
4954.26,4.439,you'd expect in a pixel just squeeze the
4957.11,5.16,sides of your phone to bring up the
4958.699,5.52,Google assistant we're using the AI in
4962.27,5.73,pixel 3 a to help manage your phone
4964.219,7.23,calls too I'm pretty sure we all hate
4968,5.43,getting robo calls and calls screen uses
4971.449,3.991,Google speech recognition and natural
4973.43,4.8,language processing to help you filter
4975.44,7.17,out those unwanted calls it's already
4978.23,7.32,screening millions of them now you might
4982.61,7.23,remember last year we shared our vision
4985.55,7.56,for using AR in Google Maps starting
4989.84,6.06,today on pixel phones when you use
4993.11,5.79,walking directions instead of staring at
4995.9,6.21,that blue dot on your phone you're going
4998.9,6.65,to see arrows in the real world to tell
5002.11,3.44,you where to turn next
5007.61,5.86,we're just beginning our journey with AR
5010.95,5.28,and maps and we're really excited for
5013.47,6.81,pixel users to experience this early
5016.23,5.61,preview battery life it's one of the
5020.28,4.11,most important features on a smartphone
5021.84,4.8,it makes sense people need to know that
5024.39,5.31,their phone won't quit on them before
5026.64,6.15,the end of their day pixel 3a has
5029.7,5.85,adaptive battery uses machine learning
5032.79,5.37,to optimize based on how you use your
5035.55,7.95,phone so you can get up to 30 hours on a
5038.16,7.8,single charge and with the included 18
5043.5,4.95,watt charger you'll get up to 7 hours of
5045.96,4.37,battery life with just 15 minutes of
5048.45,4.68,charging
5050.33,4.93,nixel 3 doesn't compromise on security
5053.13,4.98,either it's got the same comprehensive
5055.26,5.58,approach as pixel 3 on the hardware side
5058.11,5.13,our Titan M security chip protects your
5060.84,4.89,sensitive data on the device like login
5063.24,6.27,credentials disk encryption out data and
5065.73,5.55,OS integrity on the software side you
5069.51,4.26,get the latest Google security patches
5071.28,5.34,and updates for 3 years including
5073.77,5.04,Android q this summer so instead of
5076.62,6.83,getting slower and less secure over time
5078.81,7.02,your pixel gets better with every update
5083.45,5.71,we think this hybrid approach provides
5085.83,5.64,the strongest data protection and in a
5089.16,4.71,recent Gartner report pixel scored the
5091.47,5.15,highest for built-in security among
5093.87,2.75,smartphones
5097.96,6.31,pixal 3a offers the complete pixel
5101.69,5.49,experience and we're proud to make it
5104.27,5.61,available and affordable to more people
5107.18,4.71,around the world Verizon has been a
5109.88,4.08,great partner over the past two and a
5111.89,3.99,half years in the US and we're excited
5113.96,5.85,to be partnering with them again for the
5115.88,6.99,launch of pixel 3a and for the first

5195.99,3,Hey
5209.41,4.03,[Music]
5211.489,6.851,for real
5213.44,7.37,[Music]
5218.34,4.93,[Applause]
5220.81,5.82,[Music]
5223.27,3.36,hi everyone
5228.88,3.93,everything from building a low-cost
5231.04,4.29,premium device like the one you just saw
5232.81,4.86,without compromising on capabilities to
5235.33,4.32,developing a truly helpful assistant are
5237.67,3.69,all built on a tremendous amount of
5239.65,4.17,research and innovation under the covers
5241.36,5.79,and they're examples of what we do at
5243.82,5.37,Google AI Google AI is a collection of
5247.15,4.41,teams focused on making progress in
5249.19,5.55,artificial intelligence research across
5251.56,5.34,a wide range of different domains we
5254.74,4.08,focus on solving fundamental computer
5256.9,5.25,science challenges in order to solve
5258.82,5.25,problems for people that includes things
5262.15,4.32,like improving speech recognition models
5264.07,4.34,to answer questions faster or let you
5266.47,3.9,interact with your device quickly or
5268.41,4.27,pushing the boundaries of computer
5270.37,4.31,vision to help people interact for their
5272.68,5.46,worlds in new ways as we've seen today
5274.68,6.07,we published papers release open source
5278.14,5.28,software and apply our research to
5280.75,4.98,Google products the goal is really to
5283.42,6.39,solve problems every day that touch
5285.73,5.79,billions of people one of the things I'm
5289.81,3.87,most excited about is progress and
5291.52,4.08,language understanding as Scott
5293.68,3.96,mentioned earlier so much of our daily
5295.6,4.62,life depends on actually understanding
5297.64,5.15,language reading traffic signs and
5300.22,5.21,shopping lists writing emails
5302.79,5.14,communicating with the people around us
5305.43,4.71,we'd really want computers to have the
5307.93,4.98,same fluency with languages that we do
5310.14,4.9,not just understand surface forms of the
5312.91,5.82,words but actually understand what
5315.04,5.52,sentences mean unlocking that would get
5318.73,3.63,us closer to our mission of organizing
5320.56,5.82,the world's information and making it
5322.36,6.38,universally accessible and useful in the
5326.38,5.07,past few years we've made major strides
5328.74,5.38,take teaching a machine to answer
5331.45,5.93,questions like this one about Carlsbad
5334.12,6.18,Caverns a national park in New Mexico
5337.38,5.53,only recently the state of the art
5340.3,4.32,language record architecture for
5342.91,4.52,language understanding was something
5344.62,5.37,called a recurrent neural network or RNN
5347.43,5.23,Aaron ends process words sequentially
5349.99,4.35,one at one after another they work well
5352.66,3.9,for modeling short sequences like
5354.34,5.16,sentences but they struggle to make
5356.56,5.13,abstract associations like knowing that
5359.5,3.15,stalactites and stalagmites or natural
5361.69,3,formations
5362.65,7.23,and that cement pathways for example or
5364.69,7.89,not in 2017 we made a leap forward with
5369.88,6.45,our research on transformers models that
5372.58,6.51,process words in parallel one year later
5376.33,4.409,we used it as a foundation for a
5379.09,3.48,technique we called bi-directional
5380.739,4.321,encoder representations from
5382.57,7.169,transformers it's a bit of a mouthful so
5385.06,6.72,we just call it Burt Burt models can
5389.739,3.631,consider the full context of a word by
5391.78,3.169,looking at the words that come before
5393.37,4.5,and after it
5394.949,5.491,they're pre trained using plain text
5397.87,6.3,from the web and other textual sources
5400.44,5.11,to do that we use a process to Train it
5404.17,5.19,that's a little like the word game of
5405.55,6.51,mad libs we hide about 20% of the input
5409.36,5.04,words and we train the model to guess
5412.06,4.44,those missing words you can actually try
5414.4,3.63,this at home with a bit of text that you
5416.5,3.39,have hide a few words and see if you can
5418.03,4.62,guess what they are that's effectively
5419.89,4.349,what we're doing this approach is much
5422.65,4.35,more effective for understanding
5424.239,5.46,language when we published the research
5427,4.8,Burt obtained state of the art results
5429.699,6.21,on eleven different language processing
5431.8,6,tasks fast forward to today and we're
5435.909,3.81,excited to see how Burt can help us
5437.8,4.98,answer more complex questions that are
5439.719,4.5,relevant to you whether that's getting
5442.78,3.84,the flight time from Indiana
5444.219,5.221,to Honolulu learning a new weight
5446.62,6.78,lifting exercise or translating between
5449.44,5.61,languages research like this gets us
5453.4,4.529,closer to technology that can truly
5455.05,5.37,understand language we're now working
5457.929,4.56,with product teams all across Google to
5460.42,5.58,see how we can use Burt to solve more
5462.489,4.831,problems in more places we're excited to
5466,2.909,bring those to people around the world
5467.32,5.49,to help them get the information they
5468.909,5.131,need every day all this machine learning
5472.81,5.61,momentum though wouldn't be possible
5474.04,6.119,without platform innovation tensorflow
5478.42,3.48,is the software infrastructure that
5480.159,4.531,underlies our work in machine learning
5481.9,3.66,and artificial intelligence when we
5484.69,2.91,developed tensorflow
5485.56,3.659,we wanted everyone to be able to use
5487.6,4.53,machine learning so we made it an
5489.219,6.241,open-source platform and while it's been
5492.13,4.77,essential to our work we've been amazed
5495.46,3.15,to see what other people outside of
5496.9,4.74,Google have used it for all kinds of
5498.61,6.15,different things we've seen engineers at
5501.64,5.79,Roma tre University in Italy parsing
5504.76,5.04,handwritten medieval manuscripts we've
5507.43,4.71,seen coders in France colorizing black
5509.8,5.22,and white photography we've even seen
5512.14,7.38,companies developing Fitness sensors for
5515.02,7.47,cows the work that people are doing is
5519.52,5.37,really inspiring to us it pushes us to
5522.49,2.91,keep asking ourselves how come machine
5524.89,2.73,learning
5525.4,5.21,crack open previously unsolvable
5527.62,6.15,problems in order to help more people
5530.61,6.94,one example is our work in the field of
5533.77,5.58,healthcare we're really optimistic that
5537.55,4.05,our research can create real world
5539.35,4.29,impact in medicine by improving
5541.6,4.86,solutions and establishing new
5543.64,5.37,diagnostic procedures to share more
5546.46,4.4,here's dr. Lilly Peng from the Google AI
5549.01,11.04,healthcare team
5550.86,10.7,[Music]
5560.05,5.26,thanks Jeff
5561.56,6.63,so as a doctor what I care about most is
5565.31,6.78,improving patients lives and that means
5568.19,6.63,good care and accurate diagnosis that's
5572.09,5.31,why I was so excited two years ago at
5574.82,5.37,i/o when we shared our work in diabetic
5577.4,6.18,retinopathy this is a complication of
5580.19,6.18,diabetes that puts over 400 million
5583.58,5.79,people around the world at risk for
5586.37,5.31,vision loss since then we've been
5589.37,3.21,piloting this work with patients in
5591.68,3.93,clinical settings
5592.58,5.55,our partners at verily recently received
5595.61,4.47,European regulatory approval for the
5598.13,4.38,machine learning model and we have
5600.08,3.96,clinical deployments in Thailand and in
5602.51,4.83,India that are already screening
5604.04,5.7,thousands of patients in addition to
5607.34,6.99,diabetes one of the other areas we think
5609.74,6.96,AI can help doctors is in oncology today
5614.33,5.34,we'd like to share our work on another
5616.7,6.72,project in cancer screening where AI can
5619.67,6.75,help catch lung cancer earlier so lung
5623.42,5.76,cancer causes more deaths than any
5626.42,6.66,cancer it's actually the most common
5629.18,6.9,causes cause of death mortality of death
5633.08,5.97,globally accounting for 3 percent of
5636.08,5.46,annual mortality we know that when cases
5639.05,4.92,are diagnosed early patients have a
5641.54,6.18,higher chance of survival but
5643.97,6.96,unfortunately over 80% of lung cancers
5647.72,5.16,are not caught early randomized
5650.93,4.2,controlled trials have shown that
5652.88,5.19,screening with low dose ETS can help
5655.13,5.97,reduce mortality but there's opportunity
5658.07,5.19,to make them more accurate so in a paper
5661.1,4.62,we are about to publish in Nature
5663.26,5.04,Medicine we describe a deep learning
5665.72,6.99,model that can analyze CT scans and
5668.3,5.94,predict lung malignancies to do it we
5672.71,4.11,trained a neural network with
5674.24,4.53,de-identified lung cancer scans from our
5676.82,5.97,partners at the NCI the National Cancer
5678.77,7.02,Institute and Northwestern University by
5682.79,5.04,looking at many examples the model
5685.79,4.83,learns to detect malignancy with
5687.83,4.46,performance that meets or exceeds that
5690.62,6.09,of trained radio
5692.29,8.02,so concretely helmet this help very
5696.71,6.06,early-stage cancer is miniscule and can
5700.31,4.74,be hard to see even for seasoned
5702.77,4.83,radiologists which means that many
5705.05,6.27,patients with late stage lung cancer
5707.6,6.15,have subtle signs on earlier scans so
5711.32,5.82,take this case where at asymptomatic
5713.75,6.84,patient with no history of cancer had a
5717.14,5.39,CT scan for screening this scan was
5720.59,4.62,interpret as normal
5722.53,5.5,one year later that same patient had
5725.21,5.78,another scan they picked up a late stage
5728.03,6.09,cancer one that's much harder to treat
5730.99,6.97,so we used our AI system to review that
5734.12,6.6,initial scan so let's be clear this is a
5737.96,5.28,tough case we showed this initial scan
5740.72,6.33,to other radiologists and five out of
5743.24,6.21,six missed this cancer but our model was
5747.05,3.78,able to detect these early signs one
5749.45,5.94,year before the patient was actually
5750.83,6.93,diagnosed one year and that year could
5755.39,6.8,translate to an increased survival rate
5757.76,4.43,of 40% for patients like this
5762.42,3.25,[Music]
5769.12,5.89,so clearly this is a promising but early
5772.7,3.9,results and we're very much looking
5775.01,4.41,forward to partnering with medical
5776.6,5.76,community to use technology like this to
5779.42,5.69,help improve outcomes for patients now I
5782.36,2.75,hand it back to Jeff
5788.269,6.841,thanks Lily the same technologies that
5792.889,4.411,you saw it just saw driving healthcare
5795.11,6.12,innovation have applications across
5797.3,6.239,almost every field imaginable our AI for
5801.23,4.86,social good program brings together our
5803.539,3.991,efforts to use AI to explore and address
5806.09,5.009,some of the world's most challenging
5807.53,5.91,problems last year we announced the
5811.099,4.531,program and it's two pillars research
5813.44,5.009,and engineering and building the
5815.63,5.85,external ecosystem let's talk first
5818.449,4.681,about research and engineering one
5821.48,3.389,project for where we're working that's
5823.13,5.339,already creating impact is our work on
5824.869,5.911,flood forecasting floods are the most
5828.469,2.94,common deadliest natural disasters on
5830.78,3.959,the planet
5831.409,5.971,every year they affect up to 230 million
5834.739,6.271,people across the world more than storms
5837.38,6.359,and earthquakes combined 20% of flood
5841.01,4.229,fatalities happen in India alone this is
5843.739,6.021,a problem that we're even seeing this
5845.239,6.931,week with the impact from cyclone phony
5849.76,4.72,floods prevent kids from being able to
5852.17,3.81,play in their neighborhoods or parents
5854.48,3.21,from protecting and providing for their
5855.98,4.139,families often because they don't have
5857.69,4.29,enough advance warning and without
5860.119,4.02,consistent accurate warning systems
5861.98,3.259,people are prone to ignore warnings and
5864.139,3.661,be unprepared
5865.239,6.88,that's especially detrimental in areas
5867.8,6.629,hit with annual monsoons that's why last
5872.119,3.721,fall we shared our work on flood
5874.429,4.681,forecasting models that can more
5875.84,6.989,accurately predict flood timing location
5879.11,5.909,and severity through a partnership with
5882.829,3.991,India central Water Commission we began
5885.019,4.43,sending early flood warnings to the
5886.82,5.1,phones of users who might be affected
5889.449,4.54,today we're thrilled to announce the
5891.92,4.23,expansion of our detection and alerting
5893.989,4.8,system for the upcoming monsoon season
5896.15,4.71,the expanded area will cover millions of
5898.789,5.221,people living along the Ganges and
5900.86,5.429,Brahmaputra River areas not only are we
5904.01,4.259,increasing the area of coverage but
5906.289,4.77,we're also better forecasting where the
5908.269,5.491,floods will hit hardest through a new
5911.059,4.29,version of our public alerts people can
5913.76,3.66,better understand whether they'll be
5915.349,5.64,affected so they can protect themselves
5917.42,4.54,and their families our model simulates
5920.989,3.311,water behavior
5921.96,5.31,across the floodplain showing the exact
5924.3,5.43,areas that will be affected we combined
5927.27,4.92,thousands of satellite images to create
5929.73,4.47,high-resolution elevation maps using a
5932.19,4.13,process similar to stereographic imaging
5934.2,4.65,to figure out the height of the ground
5936.32,3.94,we then use neural networks to correct
5938.85,3.93,the terrain so it's even more accurate
5940.26,5.97,and then we use physics to simulate how
5942.78,4.47,flooding will happen we also collaborate
5946.23,2.82,with the government to receive
5947.25,6.57,up-to-date streamgage measurements and
5949.05,6.09,send forecasts in real time we're
5953.82,3.63,excited to continue working with
5955.14,4.44,partners to increase the accuracy and
5957.45,3.81,precision of these models which we hope
5959.58,5.22,will make people safer from flooding all
5961.26,7.32,around the world research like this is
5964.8,5.76,critical but we also know that AI will
5968.58,4.05,have the biggest impact when people from
5970.56,3.9,many different backgrounds all come
5972.63,5.82,together to develop new solutions to
5974.46,6.15,problems they see that's why the second
5978.45,5.19,pillar of our AI for social good program
5980.61,5.73,is to build the external ecosystem we
5983.64,4.59,want to empower everyone to use AI to
5986.34,3.53,solve problems they see in their
5988.23,4.86,communities
5989.87,6.96,last year we partnered with google.org
5993.09,7.14,to launch the Google AI impact challenge
5996.83,5.53,it was a call for nonprofits social
6000.23,4.47,enterprises and universities to share
6002.36,5.91,their ideas for using AI to address
6004.7,6.39,societal challenges we've received
6008.27,5.46,applications from 119 countries across
6011.09,6.35,six continents representing all kinds of
6013.73,5.85,sizes and types of organizations today
6017.44,6.76,we're really excited to announce the
6019.58,6.86,22nd to day let's give them a warm
6024.2,2.24,welcome
6031.83,4.08,there's the list of organizations these
6034.02,4.98,organizations are working on some of the
6035.91,5.7,world's most meaningful issues laFonda
6039,4.83,see ahmed saul saul frontier is using
6041.61,5.49,image recognition to help medical staff
6043.83,5.88,analyze antimicrobial images in order to
6047.1,6.24,prescribe the right antibiotics for
6049.71,5.94,bacterial infections New York University
6053.34,4.32,in partnership of the fire department of
6055.65,4.13,new york city is building a model to
6057.66,4.38,help speed up emergency response times
6059.78,6.04,this could really improve public health
6062.04,6.21,and safety and ma carrera University in
6065.82,4.65,Uganda will use AI to create a
6068.25,4.05,high-resolution monitoring network to
6070.47,5.85,shape public policies for improving
6072.3,5.85,their quality we'll be supporting our 20
6076.32,5.19,grantees and bringing these ideas to
6078.15,8.22,life we're providing 25 million dollars
6081.51,6.75,in funding from Google org as well as
6086.37,4.77,coaching and resources from teams all
6088.26,5.45,across Google congratulations to all our
6091.14,2.57,grantees
6097.82,5.63,as we head into the next decade I'm
6101.87,4.2,really excited about what's to come
6103.45,5.47,there are so many promising avenues for
6106.07,5.79,fundamental research for instance
6108.92,4.65,machine learning models today typically
6111.86,4.56,we are we can get them to be good at
6113.57,4.62,solving individual tasks but what if
6116.42,4.74,they could generalize across thousands
